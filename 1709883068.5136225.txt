It includes:\n  - A "Title" at the top of the box.\n  - Two buttons labeled "Edit" and "Delete," indicating options to modify or remove the template.\n  - A "Description" field below the title.\n  - A section labeled "Rewards:" with text underneath that says "60 points Ice cream," which seems to indicate the rewards for completing the task.\n\nOn the right side:\n- The right side seems to be a form to create a new task, with various fields to fill in:\n  - A "Title" field at the top.\n  - A "Description" field below the title.\n  - A "Points reward" field with a note that says "[number input only]," indicating that only numerical values should be entered.\n  - An "Extra reward" field with a note that says "[this is a dropdown menu]," suggesting that users can select from predefined rewards.\n  - A "Schedule" section with a checkbox that is checked, followed by circular icons with the letters M, T, W, T, F, S, S on them, representing the days of the week (Monday through Sunday). This likely allows users to select which days the task should be scheduled.\n  - An "Assign time" field with a placeholder text "[Insert time field here]," where users can specify the time for the task.\n  - An "Expires after hours" field with a placeholder "[Number input here]," where users can define how many hours after assignment the task expires.\n  - A button at the bottom labeled "Create Task," which is presumably used to save the new task into the system.\n\nThe overall design is simple and utilitarian, with a focus on functionality and ease of use. The color scheme is minimal, with the use of black, white, and shades of gray, except for the "Create Task" button, which is green, likely to draw attention to the primary action on the form.'}]
